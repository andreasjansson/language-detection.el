In the same thread it will Extract the XML Data and Form a NSMutableDictionary & NSMutableArray 

something like this, 

NSMutableArray  *rootArray = will contain all first level of item, 

each element of rootArray will be of type OutlineViewData class, this will contain any additional info whether they are single element or it can be another group item , 

if at all they are group item again there will be an array and so on..
