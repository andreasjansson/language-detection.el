Test.hs:10:7:
    No instance for (Show (Int -> Int))
      arising from a use of `quickCheck' at Test.hs:10:7-33
    Possible fix: add an instance declaration for (Show (Int -> Int))
    In the expression: quickCheck prop_composition
    In the definition of `main': main = quickCheck prop_composition
